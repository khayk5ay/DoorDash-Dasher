# DoorDash-Dasher

This was originally done in Kaggle before uploading to Github.

I have also imported the dataset for the task

The task was to develop a model that can predict as accurately as possible the time it would take for a customer to receive their DoorDash order based on certain features of the order and order conditions

The model is a Simple Linear Regression Model from Scikit learn package
